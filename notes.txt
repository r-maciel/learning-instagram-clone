If you make changes to sass file you need to run >>npm run dev

Using tinker

>> php artisan tinker 

>>> $profile = new  \App\Profile();
=> App\Profile {#3181}
>>> $profile->title = 'Cool title';
=> "Cool title"
>>> $profile->description = 'Description';
=> "Description"
>>> $profile->user_id = 1;
=> 1
>>> $profile->save();

You can save the changes of a model that is related to our pricipal model with push, in the next example we're saving the change of url in our model profile that is related to our user;
>>> $user->profile->url = 'www.freecodecamp.org';
=> "www.freecodecamp.org"
>>> $user->push();

Elimina todo lo que sta en la tabla del modelo
ModelName::truncate();

to create a symbolic link from our directory public/storage to storage/app/public, the last one is where our file really is, but we need to find it in public/storge because it is the only route accessible for the public in our app
>> php artisan storage:link 

When we make a change in our frontend files is gonna compile them
>> npm run watch

NOTE: For many to many relationships we needto create a pivot table where we store the ids of the related tables/models
